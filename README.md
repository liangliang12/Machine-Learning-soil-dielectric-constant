# Machine-Learning-soil-dielectric-constant
A machine learning dielectric constant could used to simulate soil mixture medium soil properties

# introduction
The build soil dielectric constant model can be used in an border application conditions. Specifically, the operating frequency range is 0.4–20 GHz, the soil moisture content range is 0.05–0.4 m³/m³, and the soil salinity content range is 0–100 g/kg.

These soil dielectric constant models were built based on Random Forest algorithm through theoptimal model value, which was proven has the high-accuracy to simulating the soil dielectric properties.
